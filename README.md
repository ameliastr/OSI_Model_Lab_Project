# OSI Model Lab Project

This project documents hands-on practice with all seven layers of the OSI Model using a virtualized IT lab environment. The exercises cover key concepts and practical skills in networking and systems administration, such as packet analysis, routing tables, file encryption, and DNS lookups.

## Lab Environment

- **ACIDC01** – Windows Server 2022 (Domain Controller)
- **ACIDM01** – Windows Server 2022 (Domain Member Server)
- **ACIWIN11** – Windows 11 PRO (Domain Workstation)
- **ACIALMA** – Alma Linux 9.3 (Standalone Workstation)
- **ACIPFSENSE** – pfSense v2.7.2 (Virtual Router)

---

## Skills Practiced

- NIC Inspection (Layer 1)
- ARP Table & Interface Statistics (Layer 2)
- Routing Table Analysis (Layer 3)
- TCP Packet Capture & Stream Analysis (Layers 4–5)
- File Compression & Encryption (Layer 6)
- DNS Queries with Nslookup (Layer 7)

## Exercises Summary

### Exercise 1 – OSI Layers 1 to 3

- **Tools used**: Device Manager, `ipconfig`, `arp -a`, `route print`
- **Skills**:
  - Identified and examined NIC settings (Layer 1)
  - Viewed ARP entries and interface stats (Layer 2)
  - Reviewed local routing table (Layer 3)

### Exercise 2 – OSI Layers 4 and 5

- **Tools used**: Wireshark, Nmap
- **Skills**:
  - Captured a TCP handshake using Wireshark
  - Followed a TCP stream on port 80

### Exercise 3 – OSI Layer 6

- **Tools used**: Windows File Explorer, Terminal
- **Skills**:
  - Compressed and encrypted files on Windows 11
  - Verified attribute changes via command line

### Exercise 4 – OSI Layer 7

- **Tools used**: `nslookup`
- **Skills**:
  - Queried local and external DNS servers
  - Retrieved authoritative nameservers for domain
